        This function performs one iteration of MCTS. It is recursively called

        Once a leaf node is found, the neural network is called to return an
        initial policy p and a value v for the state. This value is propagated
        up the search path. In case the leaf node is a terminal state, the
        outcome is propagated up the search path. The values of state_visits, state_action_visits, action_values are
        updated.

        state. This is done since v is in [-1,1] and if v is the value of a
